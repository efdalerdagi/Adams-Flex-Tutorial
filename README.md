# Adams-Flex-Tutorial
MSC Adams/View and Adams/Car tutorial for modeling a flexible upright (flex body) on an FSAE vehicle and comparing it with a rigid upright in braking simulations.
# Adams Flex Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial project using MSC Adams/View and Adams/Car to model a flexible upright (flex body) for an FSAE vehicle and compare it with a rigid upright under straight-line braking.

## Contents
- Report describing the modeling steps and simulation results
- Adams/View and Adams/Car model files
- Plots and screenshots comparing flex vs. rigid upright behavior
